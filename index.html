            <p><t>"Democratize AI", they all say. The right of the people to keep and bear AI, shall not be infringed.
            <p><t>Anybody else thinking that is not going to end well? And the reason is, just like guns and speech, AI should indeed be free.
            <p><t>But not without accountability!
            <p>Meet <a href="https://github.com/safer41/aKountable"><b>aKountable</b></a> an open source accountability stamping system for Keras models using the Blockchain. Keras is the most democratic AI library (for what everyday people call AI in 2017). And the Blockchain is a decentralized database of transactions used mainly for Bitcoin.
            <p>aKountable makes AI safer by encoding and storing Keras neural networks in the Blockchain. This makes things safer because AI programs can change their workings without modifying the code that wrote them. A neural network can solve, with a few lines of codes, what used to take lots of effort. Likewise, a neural network can change to hide or cover an error.
            <p>To give you an example, assume a neural network that runs on a robot in a hospital. We can train such a neural network example in Keras as follows:

            <p style="font-family:monospace;">neural_network.fit(X, Y)<br>
            # X: are examples of patient inputs<br>
            # Y: are the correct actions for each input</p>

            <p>Now let's say that for some reason, the dataset that was used to train the neural network does not have enough examples of patients from a minority group. In the hospital it is possible that the robot will make a mistake, suggest the wrong action and (god forbids) kill a person from a minority group. To add insult to injury, assume that the AI engineer in the hospital is not an ethical person. That engineer will fine tune the network, but this time using enough examples of that specific tragic case as inputs. When the hostpital regulators come to inspect the case, the robot doesn’t repeat the same mistake and justice is never made. Mankind soul cries defeated...

            <p>Enter <b>aKountable</b>. In the future, when saferAI standards are Universal, <b>every AI deployed to production will need to be accountable</b>. In the case above, after the neural network is trained. The engineer has to run 

            <p style="font-family:monospace;">neural_network.stamp()<br>
            # this will put the neural network in the Blockchain<br>
            # the hospital has to add the generated neural network Blockchain receipt to each medical procedure going forward</p>

            <p>In that case, the “Blockchain receipt” generated is a unique, time stamped Bitcoin transaction stored in the Blockchain. The Blockchain is cyber bad hombres proof. One cannot go back in time and change it either. If the engineer tries update the neural network, it will not match the one stored in the Blockchain. The hostpital regulators catche the crime. Mankind soul smiles!

            <p>And there, friends, we take a little step forward towards a space that is safe for everybody, towards safer AI. 

            <p>Yours truly,
